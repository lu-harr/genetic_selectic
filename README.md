## Approximately optimal mosquito surveillance in Victoria

(I'm leaving the appraisal of existing surveillance in JEV land at least for now)

TODO
- Can I get "Pareto contour" from GA function as is?
- Stopping condition! (No change after n attempts)
- Option to extend chain!
- Redundancy? What proportion of designs do I have to look at to get close to exact Pareto front in toy problem? How many do I look at more than once? Would need vector of all possible sites ... this would make things take longer ...
