## Appraisal + Approximately optimal mosquito surveillance in Victoria

TODO
- Stopping condition! (No change after n attempts)
- Option to extend chain!
- Redundancy? What proportion of designs do I have to look at to get close to exact Pareto front in toy problem? How many do I look at more than once? Would need vector of all possible sites ... this would make things take longer ...

- Figure plan
  - Methods
    - ~Objective surfaces: toy problem, Victoria (2x2?)~
    - ~Cute lil genetic algot diagram~
    - ~Catchment diagram - check this is the same for appraisal and for GA~ (probably should simplify for GA)
  - Results
    - ~Victoria: results of appraisal (also a table)~
    - ~Toy problem: exact Pareto front. show what the front looks like in geographic space? (e.g. design good for risk, design good for pop, design balancing two objectives)~
    - ~Toy problem: performance under different algorithm knobs~
    - Table: time to calculate stuff (enumerate, single run of genetic algot)
    - Victoria: performance under different algorithm knobs
    - Victoria: geographic space + best objective space. 5 panel sketch including three examples in geog space (one good under risk objective, one good under pop objective, one that balances both)
