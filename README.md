## Approximately optimal mosquito surveillance in Victoria

(I'm leaving the appraisal of existing surveillance in JEV land at least for now)

TODO
- Can I get "Pareto contour" from GA function as is?
- Stopping condition! (No change after n attempts)
- Option to extend chain!
- Redundancy? What proportion of designs do I have to look at to get close to exact Pareto front in toy problem? How many do I look at more than once? Would need vector of all possible sites ... this would make things take longer ...
- Resurrect appraisal code?
- Add pop and geographic area columns to appraisal table

- Figure plan
  - Methods
    - Objective surfaces: toy problem, Victoria (2x2?)
    - Cute lil genetic algot diagram
    - Catchment diagram - check this is the same for appraisal and for GA
  - Results
    - Victoria: results of appraisal (also a table)
    - Toy problem: exact Pareto front and some Pareto contours? Or results of different runs?
      show what the front looks like in geographic space? (e.g. design good for risk, design good for pop, design balancing two objectives)
    - Table: time to calculate stuff (enumerate, single run of genetic algot)
    - Victoria: geographic space, Pareto contours? compare to results of appraisal?
